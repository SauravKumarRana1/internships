Assignment 2 – Voultofcode Internship

This repository contains my Assignment 2 for the Voultofcode Web Development Internship, where I created a dedicated Internships Page to showcase my internship experiences in a clean and responsive layout.

🚀 What I Built in This Project

✅ 1. Internship Showcase Page

Designed a separate webpage to highlight different internship experiences.

Each internship is presented with clear details such as title, role, duration, and description.


✅ 2. Responsive Layout

Built using HTML5 + CSS3 with complete responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Implemented media queries to ensure proper scaling across all devices.


✅ 3. Navigation Integration

Added “Internships” link into the main navigation bar.

Implemented a hamburger menu (mobile navigation) using JavaScript.

Smooth toggle functionality to open and close the mobile menu.


✅ 4. Internship Cards / Content Blocks

Each internship is displayed inside a clean card-style layout.

Cards include structured information, consistent spacing, and easy readability.

Designed using flexbox/grid for responsive alignment.


✅ 5. UI/UX Enhancements

Clean typography, balanced spacing, and minimal design.

Added hover effects on links and buttons for better user interaction.

Maintained consistency with the style of the main portfolio.


✅ 6. Footer / Contact Area

Added a simple footer for a complete webpage design.

Content aligns with the theme of the main portfolio site.
